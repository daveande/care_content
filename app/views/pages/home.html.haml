          Hospitals and health systems need a steady stream of content to engage patients
          online. CareContent licenses a reserve of customizable web content - health feature stories, patient quizzes,
          slide shows, current medical news articles, and more. Now, hospitals can efficiently publish patient e-newsletters,
          update landings pages and drive traffic from social media to their websites. Just select your content and publish it as is.
          Or you can add quotes from your own clinicians and information about your organization's services, programs and accolades.
